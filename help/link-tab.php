<p><strong>Link Buttons</strong></p>

<p>The <em>Link Buttons</em> will link to your profile on each of the selected social media services. This is what all the options do:</p>
		
<dl>
<dt>Image Set</dt>
<dd>Choose which icons you would like displayed on your site.   When you choose a different value, you should see the icons below change so you know what they will look like.</dd>

<dt>Caption</dt>
<dd>This text displays just before the icons.  If there's enough room, it will be to the left, otherwise it will be just above the icons</dd>

<dt>Show these services</dt>
<dd>Lets you choose which icons are displayed and in which order.  Just drag the icons to reorder them, and drag them between the selected and available boxes to include only the ones you want.</dd>

<dt>User IDs</dt>
<dd>For any service you choose, you should enter your username in the box and the URL to your page will
    be automatically generated.  If you do not have a standard URL (e.g. you have a custom or store URL)
    just enter the full url (starting with http://) in the box.</dd>

<dt>Specific Feeds</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.specificfeeds.com/rss">SpecificFeeds</a> is a free service which allows
    your visitors to subscribe to your blog by RSS or Email.
    No configuration is necessary - your visitors will be automatically linked to the Specific Feeds
    follow page (<a href="http://www.specificfeeds.com/follow">http://www.specificfeeds.com/follow</a>).
    You can also generate a unique subscription url for your
    blog <a href="http://www.specificfeeds.com/rss">here</a>.
</dd>
<p>Done forget to hit <em>Save changes</em> when you're done!</p>
