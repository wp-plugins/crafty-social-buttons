<p><strong>Share Buttons</strong></p>

<p>The <em>Share Buttons</em> will link to your profile on each of the selected social media services. This is what all the options do:</p>
		
<dl>
<dt>Image Set</dt>
<dd>Choose which icons you would like displayed on your site.   When you choose a different value, you should see the icons below change so you know what they will look like.</dd>

<dt>Caption</dt>
<dd>This text displays just before the icons.  If there's enough room, it will be to the left, otherwise it will be just above the icons</dd>

<dt>Show these services</dt>
<dd>Lets you choose which icons are displayed and in which order.  Just drag the icons to reorder them, and drag them between the selected and available boxes to include only the ones you want.<br/>
Note that there are a couple of icons you can choose that won't show up in the sharing buttons list. You can use the icons for Etsy and Craftsy to create <em>Link Buttons</em>, but there are currently no 'share via Etsy' or 'share on Craftsy' features available, so if you choose it as a Share Button, it won't be displayed</dd>.

<dt>Above or below content</dt>
<dd>Allows you to choose whether the icons are displayed directly above or below the post content (or both!)</dd>	

<dt>Show on Posts</dt>
<dd>If this is selected, the icons will be automatically added to the individual page for each post.</dd>

<dt>Show on Pages</dt>
<dd>If this is selected, the icons will be added to pages</dd>

<dt>Show on Home Page</dt>
<dd>Allows the icons to be added to the post on the home page too.  Depending on your theme, this may be too much clutter.</dd>	
 
<dt>Open in new window</dt>
<dd>This is recommended - it opens another window or tab for the user to share the post. Once they have finished and close it, they will be back at your site.</dd>

<dt>Show post counts</dt>	 
<dd>This finds out from the sharing service how many times your post has been shared, and displays the number in a little bubble next to the icon.  Not all services have this ability, so the icon will only appear if the service supports it. Calling out to the services to obtain the counts can slow down the loading of the page, so I wouldn't recommend this if you are showing the icons on your home page.</dd>

<dt>Email text</dt>	 
<dd>The default text that will be added to the email when someone shares using the email button.  It's just a suggestion - they are free to edit before they click send.</dd>

<dt>Twitter text</dt>
<dd>The default text that will be populated in their tweet when someone shares using the twitter button.  Again, it just gives them this text as a starter - they are free to edit before they actually tweet it.</dd>
